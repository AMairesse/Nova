# brief

Project: Nova

Summary:
Nova is an application that hosts multiple AI agents and tools. Each user can create agents and tools, assign tools to agents, and use agents as tools by other agents.

Scope:
- Multi-tenant agent management
- Tool creation and assignment
- Django + Django REST Framework backend
- Docker Compose deployment with multiple builtin tools and services (judge0, nginx, ollama, searxng)
- Templates, static assets, and a server-rendered frontend

Key goals:
- Reliable agent orchestration and execution
- Easy tool integration via Docker images
